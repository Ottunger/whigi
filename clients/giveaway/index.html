              Using this form, you can create a free WordPress blog linked to your Whigi account. For your ease, it comes preinstalled with the Whigi plugin,
              as well as a revised version of the s2Member plugin. With these two, you will be able to manage your users, but let them manage their accounts with
              Whigi, levaraging you from any disturbance that may arise from maintaining yourself the user's data. You will be able to sell one time products,
              or reccuring payments, to grant access to portions of your site, making this Wordpress perfect for managing a small organization list of members.
          </p>

              You will be able to reach your website at https://[your_whigi_username].envict.com, and you will be able to log in as admin using this very same 
              Whigi account. You can also use this form to reset your free WP to a clean state if you've messed up with it more than you should have.
